# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest `main` branch first.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| main | yes |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for potential vulnerabilities.

- Preferred: use GitHub Security Advisories (private report to maintainers).
- Fallback: open a regular issue only for non-sensitive security hardening topics.

When reporting, include:

- affected component and version/commit
- reproduction steps or PoC
- expected impact and attack preconditions
- suggested fix (optional)

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days.
