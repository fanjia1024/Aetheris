# Aetheris 2.1 Execution Plan (8 Weeks)

> Plan window: 2026-02-23 to 2026-04-17  
> Primary goal: make 2.x operationally release-ready (`production-ready` in `docs/STATUS.md`).

## 1. Objectives

1. Convert 2.x release gates from documentation requirements to enforced pipeline checks.
2. Close multi-tenant isolation loop (JWT -> API -> storage query boundary -> tests).
3. Make failure drills and performance baseline reproducible release evidence.
4. Produce a 2.1 RC package with runbook and rollback confidence.

## 2. Scope

In scope:

- release gate hardening (CI/release scripts/artifacts)
- tenant isolation enforcement and regression tests
- observability and drill operationalization
- snapshot/GC/retention operational validation

Out of scope (after 2.1 RC):

- full 3.0 feature productization (`sign/sync/ai/compliance` end-to-end)
- major new API surface unrelated to 2.x operations

## 3. Week-by-Week Backlog

## Week 1 (2026-02-23 to 2026-02-27) — Gate design

Planned work:

1. Define mandatory release gates (CI, perf, drill, runbook).
2. Freeze gate thresholds (throughput, P95, completion ratio).
3. Write implementation checklist for CI and scripts.

Deliverables:

- `release gate spec` document
- gate threshold table (single source)

Definition of done:

- Gate list and thresholds reviewed and agreed by maintainers.

## Week 2 (2026-03-02 to 2026-03-06) — Gate integration

Planned work:

1. Integrate perf and drill scripts into release workflow as required checks.
2. Ensure gate failures block release job.
3. Archive gate artifacts from workflow runs.

Deliverables:

- updated release workflow
- first full gate run report

Definition of done:

- A failed gate produces a blocked release job and visible artifact links.

## Week 3 (2026-03-09 to 2026-03-13) — Tenant isolation implementation

Planned work:

1. Ensure tenant identity propagation is consistent in API handlers.
2. Enforce tenant filters for job/event/query paths.
3. Document tenant boundary assumptions and non-goals.

Deliverables:

- tenant boundary enforcement patch set
- tenant protection matrix draft

Definition of done:

- All critical read/write paths show explicit tenant enforcement.

## Week 4 (2026-03-16 to 2026-03-20) — Tenant isolation verification

Planned work:

1. Add cross-tenant denial integration tests.
2. Add RBAC + tenant combined scenario tests.
3. Add regression checklist for tenant-sensitive endpoints.

Deliverables:

- tenant isolation integration test report
- endpoint-level regression checklist

Definition of done:

- Cross-tenant data access is blocked in automated tests.

## Week 5 (2026-03-23 to 2026-03-27) — Observability hardening

Planned work:

1. Improve stuck/retry/worker-health visibility.
2. Align alerts with runbook actions.
3. Add clear operator-facing troubleshooting paths.

Deliverables:

- observability field/spec update
- alert-to-runbook mapping table

Definition of done:

- On-call can identify backlog/stuck/retry problems without source inspection.

## Week 6 (2026-03-30 to 2026-04-03) — Drill closure

Planned work:

1. Standardize worker crash, API restart, and DB outage drills.
2. Ensure drill outputs are reproducible artifacts.
3. Validate drill pass/fail criteria and rollback behavior.

Deliverables:

- drill baseline report (full pass target)
- drill runbook refinements

Definition of done:

- Drill suite passes with reproducible reports and no manual ambiguity.

## Week 7 (2026-04-06 to 2026-04-10) — Capacity and lifecycle validation

Planned work:

1. Validate snapshot/GC/retention operational behavior.
2. Run 10k+ event replay/performance checks.
3. Confirm storage growth remains bounded and explainable.

Deliverables:

- capacity and lifecycle validation report
- operational parameter recommendations

Definition of done:

- No unbounded growth pattern under target load profile.

## Week 8 (2026-04-13 to 2026-04-17) — 2.1 RC

Planned work:

1. Feature freeze and bug-fix-only window.
2. Complete release checklist and gate evidence package.
3. Finalize upgrade, rollback, and ops handoff documentation.

Deliverables:

- 2.1 RC release package
- sign-off summary

Definition of done:

- 2.1 RC can be released with full gate evidence and rollback confidence.

## 4. Weekly Operating Rhythm

1. Monday: confirm weekly scope and owners.
2. Wednesday: mid-week risk review and unblock decisions.
3. Friday: artifact review, gate delta, `docs/STATUS.md` update.

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

Risk 1: Gate flakiness blocks release confidence.

- Mitigation: separate script instability from runtime regressions; keep retry policy explicit.

Risk 2: Tenant logic regressions spread across handlers.

- Mitigation: maintain endpoint-level tenant regression checklist and mandatory tests.

Risk 3: Drill results pass on local only, not CI-like environment.

- Mitigation: align drill environment with release stack profile and capture env metadata in reports.

## 6. Exit Criteria for 2.1 RC

All must be true:

1. CI and release gates pass on target branch.
2. Performance baseline report meets thresholds.
3. Failure drills pass (including DB outage scenario in release rehearsal).
4. Tenant isolation regression suite is green.
5. Runbook and rollback docs are validated and linked from release notes.
